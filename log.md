### Day 4: January 4, 2018

**Today's Items**: 

- Father's of course
-   Grandfather
-   Father
-   Father-in-law
- Chance to be a father

**Thoughts**: 

Today is obviously one of those very special days.  The day that we can reflect on someone who has
been able to fill a role in our life. I am so grateful for my father, as well as the other father
figures that I have had in my life since birth.  Without these wonderful men I would not be the man
I am today.  I am also very grateful for the chance I have to be a father, to be given children who
I can love and I can raise.

### Day 9: July 13, 2018

- Pavilions
- Pizza
- Old Songs
- Tire Swings 
- Ranchers

**Thoughts**: What an exciting day!  Had a change to get together with a number of friends and

us, as well as the fun time we had singing an old song to him (on from our youth).  The final item
is that Garett was able to start a dream job of his working as a hand for a Ranch that just opened

### Day 10: July 14, 2018

**Today's Items**: 

- Denny's
- Dryers
- WiFi 
- Neighborhood Parties 
- Couch Holders 

**Thoughts**: What a busy Saturday today.  Had a lot to do, but am grateful for Wifi and its ability
to let us connect a lot of things easily to the web.  We also have the best neighborhood, were they
setup a great summer activity each year, while I wasn't able to personally attend, my daughter had
a wonderful time.  I am also grateful for finding little items that can hold our couch in place.  We
recently installed flooring and our couches were sliding all over the place when people sat on them
but now they stay still!

### Day 11: July 15, 2018

**Today's Items**: 

- My Dad

**Thoughts**: As I have been going through this challenge, there has been one thing that seems to
have come to my attention.  I feel that, having 5 things every day, sometime detours from the specific
amounts of gratitude that I have for any one of those specific items.  With that in mind I might just
share anywhere from 1 to 5 different things that I am grateful for, depending on how important and
thankful I am for the specified items.  My father's birthday was pretty recent, but today he stopped
by my home to drop a gift off for my daughter.  He is really an amazing man who spends all his time
with his family and showing the love and kindness that he has for them.  I honeslty am so grateful
for the example that he gave me growing up, and still gives me everytime I see him.  I know that I 
still have a lot of growing to do, but I believe that he has made a hug impact on me for the better.

### Day 12: July 16, 2018

**Today's Items**: 

- Weeds
- Grass
- Hard Work

**Thoughts**: This might be an odd thing to be grateful for, however I find that 
there is something gratifying about doing some hard work in the yard and especially
when I get my kids out to help.  I think that there is to much focus today on making
things easier, but life is supposed to require work, so I hope I can impart the
ability to know how to work hard and find joy in work to my kids.
