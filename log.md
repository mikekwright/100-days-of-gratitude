I am so grateful today for all those who are willing to give of their time and knowledge to help me
in projects that I am need done.  Music is another big one to me, and today I really want to say how
thankful I am for Rock from the 80s.  I also am so glad my son is playing T-ball and that he loves
to play sports.  Finally I love being able to have waterballoon fights with my family, and to take
the shower that is usually needed afters.

### Day 4: January 4, 2018

**Today's Items**: 

- Father's of course
-   Grandfather
-   Father
-   Father-in-law
- Chance to be a father

**Thoughts**: 

Today is obviously one of those very special days.  The day that we can reflect on someone who has
been able to fill a role in our life. I am so grateful for my father, as well as the other father
figures that I have had in my life since birth.  Without these wonderful men I would not be the man
I am today.  I am also very grateful for the chance I have to be a father, to be given children who
I can love and I can raise.
